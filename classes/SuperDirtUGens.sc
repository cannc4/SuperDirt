A few UGen classes that build subgraphs for SuperDirt Synths

The panners take care of different combinations of in and out channels.

They should be used through the

*defaultPanningFunction*

which can be modified before starting a SuperDirt instance. This is still a bit experimental, but should work on any number of input and output channel settings.

In order to avoid bookkeeping on the language side, we implement cutgroups as follows:
The language initialises the synth with its sample id (some number that correlates with the sample name) and the cutgroup.
Before we start the new synth, we send a /set message to all synths, and those that match the specifics will be released.
